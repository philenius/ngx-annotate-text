  <!-- Instead of setting the property "innerText" of this HTML element, we set "data-label". In CSS, we can then
        reference the content of this property and can use the CSS pseudo- element "::after" to insert the content
        of "data-label" as text into the DOM. What's the advantage of this? At first, I tried to use the "innerText"
        property of this HTML element to visualize the annotation's label. Whenever the user selected a range of the
        original text, then the labels of the annotations were counted into the range, too. This made it difficult to
        extract which text range the user actually selected. By using the CSS pseudo-class "::after", we can prevent
        the annotations' labels from being included into the selected text range. -->

  <span class="annotation-label" [attr.data-label]="annotation.label" [style.background-color]="annotation.color">
